I am concerned with the ergonomics of the end user. I want code examples and our spec to always be geared towards the ergonimics of our end user. Routes, Validators, Services, they should feel easy to use and integrated.

Users pay in boilerplate for setting up their interfaces, once they are setup, things should feel smooth.

This is the whole point of this libary, to make setting up routes and sharing their information as easy as possible.
