I have a cli called rpp which helps me to quickly replaced files with contents on my clipboard.

I can do this:
```bash
rpp somefile.txt
```

if somefile.txt doesnt exist, itll be created and filled with the contents on the clipboard.

If somefile.txt does exist itll be overwritten with contents on the clipboard

So, when you provide a code, please also response with an appropriate `rpp` command to input the contents into my system.
